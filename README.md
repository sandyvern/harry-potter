# Harry Potter Fan Site Project

Live Site Here:

This is my 1-Week Build Challenge entry offered by Faith Wallace. The project goal is to build a simple page that is dedicated to a movie, book or television series. I've decided to do my page based on the Harry Potter book/movie series.

## Day 1

The starting day is basically creating the git repo and building the file structure for the project. The instructions are to create the file folders, and download bootstrap for use as the framework, and font-awesome for icons. Finally, we are to create our initial index.html page, and include two or three fonts to use in the page and link them in the index file.
